# Yang Liu, Physics of Fluid Group, University of Twente

I am a PhD student working on the fluid physics of large-scale wind farms and atmospheric boundary layers. Embedded in the Physics of Fluids group, I currently work with Richard Stevens on the large-eddy simulations and physical modeling of wind farms using the high-performance computing facilities.
